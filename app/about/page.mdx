About

I am currently preparing to take the PMP exam.

I'm not writing this blog as a PMP teacher.

I'm writing this blog as a PMP learner who wants to pass — and grow together with you.

I will share:

my study plans

key knowledge breakdowns

the real “what is actually confusing”

simplified notes I make along the way

My promise:

I won't publish random filler content just to post "every day".

I will publish content that actually moves us one step closer to passing.

We will pass this.
Step by step. Together.

If you also want to pass PMP — welcome.
Let's make this result happen.
