Keeping a clear stakeholder register is half the battle. Here are **7 practical examples** you can reuse and tailor.

## 1) Software delivery (SaaS) — minimal, exam-friendly

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Name | Sales Director |
| Role | Executive Sponsor |
| Interest | High (quota impact) |
| Power/Influence | High |
| Current Engagement | Supportive |
| Desired Engagement | Leading |
| Expectations | Faster feature A for enterprise deal |
| Communication | Weekly 15-min exec sync; monthly KPI email |
| Risks/Notes | Might push scope; control via CR process |

…(provide 2–3 more rows for Dev Lead, Security, Key Customer Champion)

## 2) Construction project — permit-heavy

- Add fields: *Permit Authority*, *Environmental Oversight*, *Community Representative*, *Inspection windows*  
- Engagement focus: **predictive comms cadence**, upfront approvals, formal minutes

## 3) Marketing launch — cross-functional

- Add fields: *Campaign Owner*, *Creative Lead*, *Legal Reviewer*  
- Risk: timeline compression; keep **change control** explicit

## 4) Vendor-managed hardware project

- Add fields: *Vendor PM*, *SLA owner*, *Escalation path*  
- Contract change → **formal CR**, keep register linked to contract clauses

## 5) Agile transformation (internal)

- Expect rotating stakeholders; track **engagement delta** per quarter  
- Risks: resistance; include **coaching plan** column

## 6) Public-sector grant program

- Compliance reviewer, audit office; add **evidence repository** column  
- Engage early with transparent cadence

## 7) Startup data initiative (privacy-heavy)

- Privacy officer, DPO, data owners; add **lawful basis** column  
- Communicate via **data governance forum** bi-weekly

## Power–Interest vs. Salience — quick pick

- **Power–Interest**: fast mapping for comms strategy  
- **Salience**: when **legitimacy/urgency** matters (public sector, safety)

## Engagement matrix — one line logic

If *Current* &lt; *Desired* → pick **one** tactic per sprint/iteration and re-assess.
