summary: "A frequent PMP confusion — when to record something as an issue versus a change. Here’s how PMI expects you to separate them."

## Quick Definition

| Term | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Change Log** | Tracks all *approved and rejected* change requests |
| **Issue Log** | Records problems or concerns that need resolution |

---

## Common Exam Trap

> A stakeholder complains about new requirements not being delivered — what should the PM do?

✅ Record it as an **issue**, *not* a change request (yet).  
If analysis shows scope change → *then* raise a CR.

---

## Flow in PMP Terms

1. **Issue detected** → logged in Issue Log  
2. **Analysis shows change needed** → submit **Change Request**  
3. **If approved** → update **Change Log**
