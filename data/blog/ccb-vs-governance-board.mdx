summary: 'Both can approve changes, but their scope and triggers are different. Here’s the clean way to separate them in exam questions.'

## Two boards, different scopes

**CCB (Change Control Board)**

- Focus: **project changes** that **affect baselines** (scope/schedule/cost/quality)
- Members: PM, key stakeholders, possibly Sponsor
- Output: Approve/Reject/Defer **specific CRs**

**Governance Board**

- Focus: **organizational governance**, strategy alignment, **regulatory/contractual** oversight
- Members: executives, compliance/regulatory roles
- Output: Policies, exception approvals, **major escalations**

## Exam shortcut

- “Which body approves change to the **schedule baseline**?” → **CCB**
- “A regulator **mandates** a new control, affecting multiple projects” → **Governance Board**
- “Program-wide risk leads to changed funding” → Governance board/sponsor-level decision

## When both appear

You may escalate to Governance Board for **policy/mandate** decision, then the specific project’s **CCB** implements the approved change into the project baselines.

## Mini practice

> A contractual clause needs revision affecting payment milestones across several projects. Who should decide?

**Governance Board / Sponsor** (contract, multi-project) → then each project’s **CCB** updates baselines.
