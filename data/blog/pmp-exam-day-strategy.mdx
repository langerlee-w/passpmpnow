> This is the highest ROI piece of PMP preparation: **what you do on exam day** matters more than what you studied last week.

## 1) Sleep and Food
No heavy carbs. No coffee overload. You want **even energy** not spikes.

## 2) Arrival
Arrive 30 minutes early. For online proctor → test your equipment the day before.

## 3) Section Strategy
PMP = 180 questions / 230 min

- Section 1: 60 questions
- Section 2: 60 questions
- Section 3: 60 questions

Goal = **80% pace** (don’t chase perfection)

## 4) Time Budget
- 1st 60 questions → 72 minutes
- 10 minute break
- 2nd 60 questions → 72 minutes
- 10 minute break
- final 60 questions → 72 minutes

This gives you stable pace. **Losing pace = panic = score drops.**

## 5) Question Method
Always eliminate first, never jump to answer.

1) identify question type (Predictive / Agile / Hybrid)
2) eliminate 2 wrong answers immediately
3) choose *best professional PM behavior*

## 6) Mental State
PMP is a **professional judgment** test, not memorization.

- breath through nose
- shoulders down
- micro pause every 10 questions
