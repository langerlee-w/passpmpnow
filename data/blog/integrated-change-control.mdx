summary: 'PMI tests change control as a thinking pattern. Not a checklist. If you memorize this exact mental shape, most PMP change questions become obvious.'

## The exam intent

Change Control is not “do the form”.
It is **protect the baseline** deliberately.

PMI wants to see one mental model：

> Decision follows impact analysis — not emotion.

---

## The 6-step mental shape (memorize exactly like this)

1. Receive the request (log it)
2. Analyze impact (scope / schedule / cost / quality / risk / resources)
3. Recommend action (not decide)
4. Submit to **proper authority**
5. Authority decides (CCB / governance / delegated PM)
6. Update baselines + plans + comms

If you answer before step 2 → 错。

---

## What questions are _really_ testing

Typical wrong distractors：

- PM “approves small changes”
- PM asks sponsor because nervous
- team starts implementing because “urgent”
- stakeholder says “just do it” → PM yields

PMI hates这些反应。

正确永远是：

- log
- impact
- send to authority

---

## One easy mnemonic

> Change only flows **after** knowledge (impact)  
> Not before.

---

## Super high-probability wording hints

If stem mentions：

- “touches the baseline”
- “affects cost or schedule”
- “stakeholder insists”
- “small tweak but has risk”

→ the safest choice = **integrated change control** path

---

## Authority who decides?

Short rule：

- Baseline → **CCB**
- unclear boundary → **governance**
- explicitly delegated area → PM

## If you only memorize ONE trigger phrase

> **Impact analysis FIRST. Approval SECOND.**

This single sentence can solve 20+ change items in your exam.
