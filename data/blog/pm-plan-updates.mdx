## When to Update

Whenever an **approved change** affects project baselines or components,  
the **Project Management Plan (PMP)** must be updated.

---

## Example Triggers

- New schedule baseline approved
- Risk response added
- Quality metrics revised
- Procurement terms changed
- Stakeholder strategy updated

---

## Remember the Logic

1. **Change request approved**
2. **Plan updated**
3. **Work authorization follows**

Never update the plan _before_ formal approval.

---

## Integration & Control

This process lives inside **Perform Integrated Change Control** — one of the most cross-domain topics in PMP.
