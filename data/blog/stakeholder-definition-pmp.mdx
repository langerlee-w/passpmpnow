## Definition (PMP standard)

A **stakeholder** is **any person or organization** that **can impact**, **be impacted by**, or **perceive** that they can be impacted by a project decision, activity, or outcome.

This is the official PMI / PMBOK definition.

Memorize the **three verbs**:

- impact
- be impacted
- *perceive* they can be impacted ← **this is often the trick in exam**

---

## Example

You are building an internal reporting dashboard.

- The CFO → uses the dashboard to approve budgets (directly impacted)
- The Data Team → provides data to the dashboard (impacts the project)
- The Procurement Manager → thinks this dashboard will reduce her manual work (perceives impact)

All three → are **stakeholders**.

## Key point for exam

Stakeholder **is NOT only** “customer”.

In PMP, stakeholder coverage is **broad**.

The correct view is:

> “Anyone who thinks they are affected — counts.”
