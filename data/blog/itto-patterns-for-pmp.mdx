> PMP winners do not memorize ITTO tables. They see patterns. This is the shortcut.

## Pattern 1 — Inputs that repeat everywhere
- Project Management Plan
- OPAs (Organizational Process Assets)
- EEFs (Enterprise Environmental Factors)

If you're stuck → these 3 are safe input suspects.

---

## Pattern 2 — Outputs that always show up in planning
- Project Documents Updates
- Change Requests

Planning → leads to more clarity → leads to changes.

---

## Pattern 3 — Tools that signal Agile mindset
- Facilitation
- Workshops
- Coaching / Mentoring
- Servant Leadership

If the question sounds like people-driven → Agile tool.

---

## Pattern 4 — Predictive = documents, Agile = conversation
- Gantt → Predictive
- Daily Standup → Agile

If question says “flexible requirements” → Agile tool wins.

---

## Pattern 5 — Control processes love data
- Performance Evaluation
- Trend Analysis
- Variance Analysis

If question is about measurement → these tools show up.
