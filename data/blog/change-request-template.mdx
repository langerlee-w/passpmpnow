## Why Change Requests Matter

In PMP, a **change request (CR)** is the _formal_ way to propose a modification to any project document, deliverable, or baseline.  
PMI tests this because many candidates confuse “asking for change” with “documenting a change.”

## What Every Change Request Includes

A proper CR usually has:

1. **Description of the change**
2. **Reason or justification**
3. **Impact analysis** (scope, schedule, cost, quality)
4. **Recommended actions**
5. **Approval section** (for the Change Control Board)

Example question:

> The project manager verbally approves a scope addition. What went wrong?

✅ Correct answer: _Change not formally documented — violates Integrated Change Control._

## Exam Trick

If the question says:

> “Client requested a change via email — what should PM do next?”

👉 _Document it in a change request and submit for review._
