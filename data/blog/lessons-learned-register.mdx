## What It Is

A **Lessons Learned Register (LLR)** captures what worked and what didn’t — during the project, *not only at the end.*

PMI emphasizes **ongoing learning**, not just postmortems.

---

## Typical Entries

- Communication challenges and fixes  
- Vendor response times  
- Estimation errors  
- Stakeholder engagement wins  
- Process improvements to retain

---

## Exam Focus

> When should the project team record lessons learned?

✅ *Throughout the project lifecycle*, not only at closure.

LLR is part of the **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** update.

---

## Integration Connection

When closing, lessons are transferred to the **Organizational Knowledge Repository**.  
That’s why PMI calls this *“manage project knowledge.”*
