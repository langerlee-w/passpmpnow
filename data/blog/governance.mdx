## One brutal truth

**Governance = where decisions happen above the PM.**

You escalate when the decision is:

- beyond PM delegated authority  
- conflicts with policies  
- impacts baseline  
- requires organizational alignment

---

## You do **NOT** escalate when:

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Team disagreement | coach, facilitate, clarify |
| Stakeholder is confused | communicate again, re-align |
| Requirement unclear | go back to business analyst / voice of customer |

---

## You **DO** escalate when:

| Situation | Why escalate |
|---|---|
| Baseline change (scope/time/cost) | CCB decision, not PM |
| Policy conflict | governance > team |
| Ethical risk | PMI expects you to protect org |
| Sponsor vs director conflict | PM cannot override authority |

**Exam trigger phrase**  
> “PM has no authority to decide this”

Answer → escalate to **right governance body**.

## PMI loves this stem

> Team wants to “just implement” a new change to avoid delays. What do you do?

Correct = **follow formal change control**, not hero action.

---

## Quick mnemonic

- **Team** solves **misalignment**
- **Governance** solves **authority**
