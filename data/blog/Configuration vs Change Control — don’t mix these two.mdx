title: "Configuration vs Change Control — don’t mix these two"

summary: "PMP tries to trick you by mixing these two. Configuration keeps product consistent. Change control protects the baseline. This separation solves many exam traps."

## The clean mental split

| Topic | It protects | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Configuration Management** | the *product* design / spec consistency | which WBS deliverable version is “official” |
| **Change Control** | the *baseline* (scope / schedule / cost) | if a stakeholder wants to add new reporting feature |

If question is about **version, spec, correct technical file** → Configuration.

If question is about **impact to scope/cost/schedule** → Change Control.

## PMI loves this trap

They will say things like：

- “Which system prevents product confusion among teams?”  
→ **Configuration**

- “Which process validates & decides whether a requested change is allowed?”  
→ **Integrated Change Control**

## Ultra short memory aid

> Configuration = “which is the right version?”  
> Change control = “can we even change it?”

---

## When these two touch each other

Real life & exam both：

- change request arrives  
- impact analysis says “OK”  
- baseline is approved to change  
- THEN configuration management will update the new version spec & keep history

流程顺序是：

1) Change control → **authorizes** change  
2) Configuration mgmt → **records & protects** the new official version

## Most testable stem keyword signals

| If stem says… | Bias toward… |
|---|---|
| version / specification / technical document | Configuration |
| baseline / variance / impact to cost or schedule | Change Control |
| traceability / item indexing / access control | Configuration |
| approval / governance / authority | Change Control |
