## Why this is tested a lot

Because it connects two domains:

- Stakeholder Engagement (Domain 1)
- Communication (Domain 2)

and PMI wants to see if you know the **goal** → move stakeholders toward **supportive**.

The matrix has 5 levels:

| Level      | Meaning                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Unaware    | Doesn’t know about project or impact   |
| Resistant  | Knows about it but does not support it |
| Neutral    | Has no strong feelings                 |
| Supportive | Cares and helps                        |
| Leading    | Provides direction + champions change  |

**Exam Trick**  
If question says **they block the initiative** → “Resistant”  
If question says **they show no interest** → “Neutral”  
PMI rarely uses the word “skeptical”. They use “resistant”.

## Your job in the exam

1. **Identify current engagement level**
2. **Plan your target level**
3. **Work communications + change mgmt** to get them closer

Example:

> Finance director is neutral. You want her to support your change to forecasting approach.

Correct plan: **Increase engagement with tailored communication** (NOT force, NOT escalate)

## When do you use the matrix vs Power–Interest vs Salience?

| If question is about…          | Use                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Priority / who to handle first | Power–Interest Grid                  |
| Escalation / governance        | Salience Model                       |
| How engaged should they be?    | **Stakeholder Engagement Matrix** ✅ |
