The PMP wants to see whether you pick **one specific tactic** to move a key stakeholder from the current level to the desired one.

- Unaware → share **project vision** async (1-pager)
- Resistant → **listen first**; address constraint; show small win
- Neutral → assign **lightweight role**; invite to demo
- Supportive → **recognize** contribution; include in showcase
- Leading → **co-create** roadmap; broadcast success story
