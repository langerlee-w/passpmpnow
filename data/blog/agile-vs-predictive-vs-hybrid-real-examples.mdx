summary: "Most PMP exam questions are NOT about definitions. They are about recognizing the delivery mode from context clues."

> PMP is NOT asking “What is Agile?” It asks “What should you do in this situation?”

## Predictive Example
Requirements locked, scope baseline approved, changes must go through CCB.

→ You protect schedule. You minimize variance.

Correct behavior = follow change control.

---

## Agile Example
Requirements are emerging. Customer can change priority every sprint.

→ You facilitate collaboration. You focus on outcomes.

Correct behavior = empower team, continuous delivery.

---

## Hybrid Example
Hardware (predictive) + Software (Agile)

→ Some work is planned upfront, some evolves iteratively.

Correct behavior = combine governance + iteration.

## Exam Trick
Words that signal predictive:
- baseline
- variance
- control

Words that signal agile:
- backlog
- empower
- collaborate

Hybrid = when BOTH domains exist in the SAME scenario.
