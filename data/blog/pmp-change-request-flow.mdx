## Change Request Flow (Exact Sequence)

1. Identify the change
2. Analyze impact (cost, schedule, risk, quality, scope)
3. Submit formal change request
4. CCB reviews and decides
5. Update baselines / plans (if approved)
6. Communicate decision to stakeholders
7. Implement the approved change
8. Update lessons learned

## Most common exam trap

Team member applies the change **before** the CCB reviews it.

Correct behavior: **always** process change through the formal system.

## If question gives you 2 correct choices

- choose the one with “analysis first”
- not the one that jumps to “approve / implement”
