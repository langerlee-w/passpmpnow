## Why It’s Important

Every PMP question that mentions _“variance”_ or _“deviation”_ secretly tests your understanding of **baseline vs actual**.

- **Baseline** = approved plan
- **Actual** = real performance data

## Typical Confusions

| Term              | Meaning                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Cost Baseline     | Time-phased budget (what we _plan_ to spend) |
| Actual Cost (AC)  | What we _really_ spent                       |
| Schedule Baseline | Approved project timeline                    |
| Actual Dates      | What actually happened                       |

Variance = Actual – Baseline.

## Exam Example

> Earned value = $50,000, Actual Cost = $60,000.  
> Is the project under or over budget?

✅ Over budget (AC > EV). Baseline comparison drives performance evaluation.

## Integration Connection

You can’t change a baseline unless you go through **Integrated Change Control**.  
That means — _a new baseline = an approved change request._
