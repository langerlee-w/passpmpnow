## Why It’s Important

Every PMP question that mentions *“variance”* or *“deviation”* secretly tests your understanding of **baseline vs actual**.

- **Baseline** = approved plan
- **Actual** = real performance data

---

## Typical Confusions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| Cost Baseline | Time-phased budget (what we *plan* to spend) |
| Actual Cost (AC) | What we *really* spent |
| Schedule Baseline | Approved project timeline |
| Actual Dates | What actually happened |

Variance = Actual – Baseline.

## Exam Example

> Earned value = $50,000, Actual Cost = $60,000.  
> Is the project under or over budget?

✅ Over budget (AC > EV). Baseline comparison drives performance evaluation.

---

## Integration Connection

You can’t change a baseline unless you go through **Integrated Change Control**.  
That means — *a new baseline = an approved change request.*
