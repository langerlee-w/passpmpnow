summary: PMP often tests the difference between the Power–Interest grid and the Salience model. Here’s the fast way to know which to pick.

## Why this is so frequently tested

Because both classify stakeholders — but **they serve different exam purposes**.

**Power–Interest grid** = for **prioritization**
<br />
**Salience model** = for **governance escalation**

## Power–Interest Grid

Used early — during **identify stakeholders**.

You categorize by:

- **Power** (can this person kill your project?)
- **Interest** (do they care about outcomes?)

Result = 4 quadrants

- High Power / High Interest → **Manage closely**
- High Power / Low Interest → Keep satisfied
- Low Power / High Interest → Keep informed
- Low Power / Low Interest → Monitor

If the question is about **prioritizing** communications, resources, or time → **pick Power–Interest**.

## Salience Model

Used later — when **governance decisions** arise.

Based on three attributes:

- **Power**
- **Legitimacy**
- **Urgency**

More attributes = higher salience rank.

If exam question mentions:

- “Who should approve this?”
- “Who is the right escalation path?”
- “Which stakeholder has the right to make this decision?”

→ Answer will lean toward **Salience**.

## Fast Rule you can memorize

- If the question is about **influence level** or **prioritize who to engage first** → Power–Interest
- If the question is about **formal authority** or **who must approve** → Salience

## Practice to make it stick

Which tool would you use?

Example:

> Regulatory body sends an urgent request to change reporting format.

Answer: **Salience** (urgency + legitimacy + power)
