summary: "99% of PMP change questions boil down to one sentence: who is allowed to approve this change?"
---

## One sentence to tattoo on your brain

**The PM does NOT approve scope/time/cost changes.**

Period.

---

## Who approves what (memorize these 4 lines)

| Change type | Who approves |
|---|---|
| Scope baseline | Change Control Board (CCB) |
| Time baseline | CCB |
| Cost baseline | CCB |
| Minor non-baseline adjustments | PM (within delegated authority) ✅ |

“delegated authority” = documented in the **change management plan**.

---

## How PMI asks the trick

> PM notices stakeholder wants more reports. What should PM do next?

Correct thinking:

1) log change request  
2) analyze impact (scope/time/cost/quality/risk/resources)  
3) submit to **CCB** for decision

Do NOT approve.  
Do NOT implement early.

---

## If a question mentions “Manager says do it quickly”

correct reaction = **follow formal change control**.
