summary: 'These two are confused even by experienced PMs — but PMP tests the distinction constantly.'

## One sentence you must memorize

- **Configuration** = keeping track of what things _are_
- **Change Control** = controlling decisions to _modify_ those things

That’s it.

---

## Why PMI separates them

Because in real companies configuration is an **inventory**.

Inventory = what do we have?

Change control = should we change any item in the inventory?

---

## Example that always locks it in

| Topic   | Configuration                                | Change Control                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| What    | version, baseline, attributes, relationships | approval, authority, impact review |
| When    | before / after changes                       | during the change decision         |
| Who     | CMDB / librarian / repository owner          | CCB / governance body              |
| Purpose | **know what exists**                         | **control modification**           |

## Exam trigger recognition

> “Which process ensures we know which requirements version is current?”

→ Configuration mgmt.

> “Which process ensures sponsor approval before modifying a requirement?”

→ Integrated Change Control.

---

## Watch for this common trap

“Update documentation”  
≠ change control decision.

Documentation update happens **after** the change authority approves.

---

## Fast 3 steps PMI expects you to think

1. Identify item → configuration
2. Evaluate requested change → change control
3. If approved → update configuration items again
