## Earned Value (EVM)
- PV = Planned Value
- EV = Earned Value
- AC = Actual Cost

### Variances
- CV = EV - AC
- SV = EV - PV

### Indexes
- CPI = EV / AC
- SPI = EV / PV

> CPI < 1 → over budget  
> SPI < 1 → behind schedule

### Forecast
- EAC = BAC / CPI (most commonly tested)

Float = LS - ES = LF - EF

## Communication Channels

## Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
EMV = probability × impact

- positive → opportunity
- negative → threat
