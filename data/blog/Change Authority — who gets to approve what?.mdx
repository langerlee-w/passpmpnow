## The core rule (you must know by heart)

**PM does not approve baseline change.**

Scope / Schedule / Cost baseline changes → **CCB** approval.

If you only memorize这一句，你已经赢过 80% 考生。

## Approval responsibility table

| Change type                    | Who approves                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Scope baseline                 | CCB                               |
| Schedule baseline              | CCB                               |
| Cost baseline                  | CCB                               |
| Minor non-baseline adjustments | PM (only if delegated explicitly) |
| Policy / governance change     | Governance body (above PM)        |

> Delegation must exist in the **change management plan**.

## Typical PMP stem wording

> Stakeholder says “this is small, just go implement quickly.”

Correct: log → analyze impact → send to CCB.

Wrong answers on exam会写：

- implement now
- ask sponsor for advice
- PM approves small changes

这些都是陷阱。

---

## PMI loves this trick phrase

> PM has no authority to decide

= escalate.

This is ALWAYS hint you must go governance / change board.

---

## what’s “impact analysis” in PMP language

Before submit to CCB，PM must evaluate effect on：

- scope
- schedule
- cost
- quality
- risk
- resources

**Impact analysis first → decision later.**

---

## Quick decision tree (memorize)

- baseline touched? → **CCB**
- unclear decision boundary? → **governance**
- small change within PM delegated area? → PM can do

Everything else → follow **formal integrated change control**.
