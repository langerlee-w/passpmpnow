summary: 'Understand who can approve changes in different contexts — PM, Sponsor, Product Owner, CCB, or Governance Board.'

## The idea

**Change Authority** = the **role or body** authorized to **approve** changes. It depends on the **type/impact** of change and your **governance model**.

## Common cases

- **Low-impact changes** (no baseline hit): PM or Product Owner (in agile)
- **Baseline-affecting changes**: **CCB** (Change Control Board)
- **High-risk / regulatory / contract changes**: Sponsor or **Governance Board**
- **Agile backlog item tweak** with no scope baseline: Product Owner (within agreed guardrails)

## How the exam tests you

- If question says: “A change impacts **cost baseline**” → escalate to **CCB**
- If question says: “Regulator requires a new compliance step” → likely **Governance Board** / Sponsor
- If question says: “Team wants to refactor within sprint, no scope/cost change” → **PO** / team-level governance

## Don’t fall into these traps

- “PM approves everything” → **Not always**
- “Customer requested → do it” → **Still** follow change control
- “Agile means no governance” → Agile has **clear** authority (PO + team + org guardrails)

## Quick checklist for answers

1. Is a **baseline** impacted?
2. Is there a **contract** or **regulation** involved?
3. Does your charter/plan name a **CCB or board**?
4. If agile and minor, is it within **PO authority**?
